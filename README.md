Red team tool for CSEC 473 

This repository contains .service and .sh files. The .service files are meant to be put in the /etc/systemd/system directory (Or an equal directory, where services are automatically run from). These services will call the .sh files, which should be put in the /bin/ directory. Each .sh file will affect a different service.
